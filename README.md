# :closed_book: Random PDF Generator
A Python Script that generates as many PDFs (with random text:scroll:) as you want with full control over the number of pages in each PDF.


# :unlock: Details and Features
* Interactive:brain: interface with input validation.
* You have the option to chose the online:desktop_computer: wordlist or the offline one.
  * One key difference is that the online wordlist doesn't have capitalized proper nouns in it, while the offline one does.
* All the words are proper English words:capital_abcd:.
* In the case of the offline wordlist, the auto random generation:rocket: of the title and the byline has some cool properties.
* You can chose the number of PDFs:notebook: you want to create and also their page numbers:hash:.
* In case of the creation of multiple PDFs:notebook: simultaneously, you can chose a fixed number of pages:hash: for all of them or give them dynamic, separate values.
* The output of the program is generated inside the folder:open_file_folder: ```Output```.
* During each run, the ```Output``` folder:open_file_folder: gets deleted:wastebasket: and recreated. 

# :chart_with_downwards_trend: Uses

The main reason for creating this was because quite a few websites now require documents:books: to be uploaded:arrow_up: to allow for other documents to be viewed or downloaded:arrow_down:. 


Now, you can run the script once:one: and generate as many documents as you want and they will almost certainly be accepted:heavy_check_mark: as they are virtually guaranteed:100: to be different than other documents:books:.
